| DeepDungeonDex | Strati | A live bestiary for Deep Dungeon. Shows target mob aggro type, a subjective threat level, vulnerability to stun, and a general overview of notable mechanics. Threat level is meant to be taken with a grain of salt, is aimed towards solo players, and assumes a general familiarity with deep dungeon mechanics and the class being played.

| Penny Pincher | tesu | Plugin for simplifying "pennying" (undercutting current lowest offer by 1).<br><br>The usual workflow for this is the following:<br>1. Open up the adjust price menu for the item you're undercutting<br>2. Click on the compare prices menu to view the current listings<br>3. Take a mental note of what the current lowest offer is<br>4. Subtract one from it<br>5. Close the current listings window<br>6. Update your item's price with the number you noted<br>7. Confirm your new price<br><br>This plugin eliminates the mental notekeeping steps in the middle by automatically copying the number you want onto your clipboard when you open the current listings window.  <br><br>Therefore, your new workflow becomes this:<br>1. Open up the adjust price menu for the item you're undercutting<br>2. Click on the compare prices menu to view the current listings<br>3. Close the current listings window<br>4. Paste the undercut value in<br>5. Confirm your new price<br><br>This both speeds up the process and reduces room for error from typos. |
